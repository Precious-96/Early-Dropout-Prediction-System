Overview
The Early Dropout Prediction System is an AI-powered tool designed to help schools identify students who are at risk of dropping out. It analyses patterns in attendance, academic performance, and behaviour to give early alerts that enable timely intervention.

Problem
Schools often struggle to detect at-risk students early because they rely on manual methods. This leads to late intervention and increased dropout rates.

Solution
The system uses machine learning models and predictive analytics to classify students into Low, Medium, or High risk. It provides dashboards, alerts, and detailed student profiles for teachers, administrators, and counsellors.

Key Features
AI-powered risk prediction
Simple dashboard for monitoring risk levels
Real-time alerts for high-risk students
Student profile pages
Weekly/Monthly reports

Impact
The system supports better student outcomes, reduces dropout rates, and empowers schools with data-driven decision-making.
